= jQAssistant TypeScript Plugin

This is the TypeScript Plugin of https://jqassistant.org[jQAssistant].
It provides a tool to extract language concepts from TypeScript code and a scanner for the resulting JSON files.

For more information on jQAssistant see https://jqassistant.org[^].

NOTE: This plugin has not been officially released yet.

== Installation

- Clone this repository and build it using Maven `mvn install`
- Download the https://repo1.maven.org/maven2/com/buschmais/jqassistant/cli/jqassistant-commandline-distribution/[ZIP distribution] of the jQAssistant command line utility and unpack it. A directory `jqassistant-commandline-distribution-2.x.x` will be created.

=== NPM Installation (global):

* run `npm install --global  @jqassistant/ts-lce`

=== NPM Installation (local):

* Run `npm install --save-dev  @jqassistant/ts-lce`
* Add the following section to the `package.json` (add additional options as needed)
+
----
"scripts": {
    "jqa": "jqa-ts-lce"
}
----

== Usage

* create a file `.jqassistant.yml` in your project root*
+
----

  plugins:
    - group-id: org.jqassistant.plugin.typescript
      artifact-id: jqassistant-typescript-plugin
      version: 1.0.0-SNAPSHOT
  scan:
    include:
      files:
        - typescript:project::build/jqa-ts-output.json
----
* execute `jqa-ts-lce`(global installation) or `npm run jqa`(local installation) from your project root (this will generate a file `.reports/jqa/ts-output.json`)
** use `--help` option to show available options for the command (when using local installation, options have to be specified in the `package.json`)
* run the jQAssistant command line utility using `jqassistant-commandline-distribution-2.x.x/bin/jqassistant.sh scan` (imports `.reports/jqa/ts-output.json` into the graph database)
* start exploring the graph by starting the embedded server `jqassistant-commandline-distribution-2.x.x/bin/jqassistant.sh server` and opening your browser at `http://localhost:7474`

*project root does refer to the directory that contains the (root) `tsconfig.json`

== Model

=== Core

The core model represents all basic TypeScript language concepts, independent of any used frameworks or libraries.

image::docs/jqa-ts-plugin-model-core.jpg[Neo4j model for the core model of the jQAssistant TypeScript plugin]

The destinations of the `REFERENCES` relations of `:Type:Declared` and `:Value:Declared` as well as all `:DEPENDS_ON` relations have been omitted for the sake of clarity.

The `REFERENCES` relation of `:Type:Declared` can target:

* `:Class`
* `:Interface`
* `:TypeAlias`
* `:Enum`
* `:ExternalDeclaration`

The `REFERENCES` relation of `:Value:Declared` can target:

* `:Variable`
* `:Function`
* `:Class`
* `:Interface`
* `:TypeAlias`
* `:Enum`
* `:EnumMember`
* `:ExternalDeclaration`

The `DEPENDS_ON` relation can originate from:

* `:Module`
* `:Class`
* `:Property`
* `:Method`
* `:AccessorProperty`
* `:Interface`
* `:TypeAlias`
* `:Enum`
* `:Variable`
* `:Function`

and can target one or more of the following nodes:

* `:Module`
* `:Module:External`
* `:ExternalDeclaration`
* `:Class`
* `:Property`
* `:Method`
* `:AccessorProperty`
* `:Interface`
* `:TypeAlias`
* `:Enum`
* `:Variable`
* `:Function`

=== React Extension

The React extension works with various concepts that represent usage patterns in the frontend framework React.

For all element types that reference some declaration, matching `DEPENDS_ON` relations are created.

== Support

This plugin should be largely compatible with all versions of TypeScript.
However, it is only developed and tested against the current version (5.1) of TypeScript.

The tool currently only supports projects using ECMAScript modules.

Currently not supported:

* old CommonJS module syntax
* hierarchical tsconfig setups
* project references in tsconfig
* scanning of multiple TypeScript projects at once
* triple-slash directives
